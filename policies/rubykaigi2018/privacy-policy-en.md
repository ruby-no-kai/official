RubyKaigi organizers not only respect, but also strive to protect your privacy. Our principle in this area is: "we refrain from gathering your personal information whenever possible."

This works most of the time. However there are several situations when we acquire your personal information:

- We use Doorkeeper https://www.doorkeeper.jp/?locale=en for ticketing. This site may gather information about you, such as your email address. RubyKaigi organizers can look at them.
- You might need an invitation letter to obtain a visa to visit Japan. While we are happy to support, doing so inevitably let us collect your personal information such as your nationality.
- We offer on-site childcare center. This service is operated by a local company with national-licensed childcare professionals. The company may request users to offer additional information such as your emergency contact number. They might ask RubyKaigi organizers to gather such information. In that case we do so.

Listed above are the situations we already know when we might gather your personal information. In all cases, and in other unexpected situations when we happen to obtain such thing, we will keep them secret. Offers to provide specific information will only be disclosed with your consent, except when we deem it necessary to protect your safety, or to respond to proper inquiry by the court, the police, or other legal body.
